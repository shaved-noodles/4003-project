# 4003-project
This project is an exploratory data analysis and visualization of NY crime data. This is the coursework for 4003: Data Skills for Computational Social Science.

I would like to thank my teammate Anwen Li. She is a great teammate and did an amazing job in brainstorming especially.
 
Since the project is too large to display on Github, I uploaded it through this link:
